  <p>If You display or distribute all or part of the Cambase Dataset (hereafter also referred to as the “Content”), You are required to provide attribution that is plainly visible to all users of the Content. Attribution gives everyone in the community the opportunity to correct errors and keep the Content up to date. Our recommended attribution guidelines are described below.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, You have the responsibility to ensure You are in full compliance with the license terms whenever You use or reuse the Content.</p>
  <h3>Attribution</h3>

  <p>When You are using Content from a specific entity within the Dataset, Cambase asks that You use a snippet in the following form:</p>
  <pre>Source: &lt;a title="NAME on Cambase" href="http://www.cambase.io/NAMESPACE/PERMALINK"&gt;NAME on Cambase&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

  <h3>Commercial Use of the Cambase Dataset</h3>
  <p>We encourage others to incorporate all or part of the Cambase Dataset into commercial applications, but to protect the community’s investment in the Cambase Dataset and safeguard the integrity of the Cambase Dataset, Cambase requires a separate license for commercial use. Commercial is defined by the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License [<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC-BY-NC</a>] as a use in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation.</p>
